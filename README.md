  Gamification is probably underused and misapplied. What if instead of enhancing the thrill of losing money or making it really satisfying to click on other people in video games we made things that improve people's lives hopelessly addictive?<br>I hope you can see my beautiful vision.

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Slotmachine SFX for VSCode.<br>Uses a few RegExs to make fun noises happen when you do certain things in the editor, and thus should possibly still be compatible with other soundpacks at the same time if you also want to hear Chinese ladies calling you handsome.</p>
<h2>How can I try it?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://saekiraku.github.io/vscode-rainbow-fart/#/en/">Download Rainbow Fart the way you usually get your VSCode Extensions.</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pelmeniboiler/gamblecore/releases">Download the latest release of Gamblecore.</a></li>
  <li>Run Rainbow Fart by opening your command palette (Default CTRL+SHIFT+P) and typing 'Enable Rainbow Fart'</li>
  <li>Rainbow Fart will run on a local address, this address should pop up in a notification in the bottom right corner of your screen, which you can then use to open the webui in your default browser.</li>
  <li>Follow Rainbow Fart's instructions to import Gamblecore.zip</li>
  <li>Enable Gamblecore in the Rainbow Fart UI</li>
  <li>Ascend.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have only gambled once to see if I could like or understand it. I took $20 Canadian and decided to play slots until I lost it all. I did not have fun for even a second but I loved the noises the machines made and thought they were funny and silly but mostly sad.<br>I lost the whole $20 except for a single cent and the Canadian lady at the counter refused to cash me out a penny or to even give me a reciept reading one cent for a funny memento.<br>A few years later, I was in Vegas every so often and I would see all sorts of bizarre even sillier machines that I could not even begin to comprehend. I love how cheesy and goofy they are but they also seem a little evil. Buffalo Ascension. China Shores. The names seem less-and-less connected to any concept of wealth or affluence and instead appear to promise a glorious adventure beneath the watchful gaze of a giant glowing display of a pulsating Buffalo.<br>Naturally, this all leads back to the age-old-question:</p>
<h3>Would a Buffalo watching me use my computer improve my habits?</h3>
<p>Would constant orchestra-hits and xylophone arpeggi pavlov me into wanting to code more if I left a 10 hour long playlist of slot machines running their attract-mode sequences on my PC while I went about my day?<br></p>
<p>I hope you start wondering this too.</p>
